Plant Disease Detection using CNN

Description

Plant diseases pose a significant threat to agricultural productivity worldwide. 
Early and accurate detection of these diseases can help in taking preventive measures and minimizing crop loss. 
This project aims to develop a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect and 
classify plant diseases from leaf images. The model leverages image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms 
to provide an efficient and scalable solution for plant disease detection.
